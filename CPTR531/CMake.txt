This is an explanation of how to use CMake & Make on Windows

In project directory, run these commands:
- mkdir debug
- cd debug
- cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
- make
This should generate a .exe file on windows as opposed to creating an SLN for Visual Studio

FOR RELEASE build
mkdir release
cd release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
